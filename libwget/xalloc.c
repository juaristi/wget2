/**
 * \file
 * \brief Memory allocation functions
 * \defgroup libwget-xalloc Memory allocation functions
 * @{
 *
 * The provided memory allocation functions are used by explicit libwget memory
 * allocations.
 * They differ from the standard ones in that they exit the program in an
 * out-of-memory situation with %EXIT_FAILURE. That means, you don't have to
 * check the returned value against %NULL.
 *
 * You can provide a out-of-memory function that will be called before exit(),
 * e.g. to print out a "No memory" message.
 *
 * To work around this behavior, provide your own allocation routines,
 * namely malloc(), calloc(), realloc().
